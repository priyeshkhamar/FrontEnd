Q - 3. What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?

Ans.
Pure components in React are a type of component that only re-renders when its props or state change. 
They are also referred to as “stateless components” or “dumb components”. 
Pure components are a way to optimize the performance of your React application by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

The React.PureComponent class is responsible for creating pure components. 
It shares similarities with the React.Component class, but it goes a step further by implementing a shouldComponentUpdate() method. 
This method automatically verifies whether there have been any changes in the component’s props or state before triggering a re-render. 
If no changes are detected, the component remains unchanged, leading to enhanced performance.

We can use Pure Component over Regular Components in the following cases : 
1. When your component frequently re-renders with the same props and state.
2. When You use immutable data structures, ensuring that changes result in new object references.
