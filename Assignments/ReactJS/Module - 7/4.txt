Q - 4. What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?

Ans.
The second argument that can optionally be passed to 'setState' in React is a callback function. This callback function is executed after the setState operation has been completed and the component has re-rendered.

Ex - 
this.setState({ key1: value1, key2: value2 }, () => {
  console.log('State has been updated:', this.state);
});
