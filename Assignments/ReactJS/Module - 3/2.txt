Q - 2. What is NPM in React JS?
-->
- NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) in React.js serves several important functions:

1. Package Management: 
NPM allows us to easily install, update, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies needed for React projects.
Ex - npm install react-router-dom

2. Version Control: 
NPM helps manage the versions of the packages you use, ensuring compatibility and stability in your project. 

3. Script Running: 
We can define and run custom scripts through NPM, such as starting the development server, building the project, or running tests.
Ex - npm start

4. Project Initialization: 
NPM can be used to initialize new projects quickly, such as using Create React App to set up a new React application.   
Ex - npx create-react-app my-app
