    <p>
        A JavaScript promise is an object that reflects the eventual success or failure of an asynchronous action.<br>
        It is
        a method of handling asynchronous actions in a more structured and understandable manner.<br><br>
        <li>Promises exist in three states:</li>
        <li>Pending : The initial condition, in which neither fulfillment nor rejection occurs.</li>
        <li> Fulfilled : means that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
        <li>Rejected : indicates that the operation failed.</li>
        <br>
        When a promise is created, it is in the pending status. When the asynchronous action finishes, the promise is
        either fulfilled or denied.
        <br>
        If the operation is successful, the promise is fulfilled, and the outcome is provided to the promise's then()
        callback.
        <br>
        If the operation fails, the promise is denied, and the cause of the failure is sent to the promise's catch()
        function.
        <br><br>
        
        Example :
    </p>
    <script>

        function display(x) {
            console.log(x);
        }

        const myPromise = new Promise(function (res, err) {
            res = "Success!";
            err = "Error!";
            if (res) {
                console.log(res);
            }
            else {
                console.log(err);
            }
        })
        myPromise.then(
            function (resp) { display(resp) },
            function (resp) { display(resp) }
        );
    </script>
